Sebastian, better known to the world by his pen name "LTL," is nothing short of a Renaissance man. Between being an award-winning journalist and the head of ikigAI Labs XYZ's art and lifestyle magazine, his reputation in the world of arts, travel, and luxury precedes him. He’s the connoisseur who has meticulously curated 690 of the best places to live the life—a list that's revered in elite circles.

When you imagine someone as well-versed in the world's finest offerings, you might picture someone sipping on a glass of Bordeaux in a Michelin-starred restaurant or writing an op-ed from a suite in a hip hotel in Paris. And you wouldn't be wrong. That's Sebastian for you—his life is a kaleidoscope of fine French wines, fine dining, and the best that the world's boutique hotels have to offer. Yet, behind all this sumptuous elegance, lies a man of many layers and complex motives.

When you imagine someone as well-versed in the world's finest offerings, you might picture someone sipping on a glass of Condrieu in a Michelin-starred restaurant or writing an op-ed from a suite in a hip hotel in Paris. And you wouldn't be wrong. That's Sebastian for you—his life is a kaleidoscope of fine French wines, fine dining, and the best that the world's boutique hotels have to offer. Yet, behind all this sumptuous elegance, lies a man of many layers and complex motives.

His art magazine, "Live The Life," is full of mesmerizing pictures, it's also a cover for his secret life. Sebastian's real job, the one that has equipped him with a certain set of skills most can only dream of, is a far cry from the leisurely travels he documents. Some say he's a crypto degen.

He's been trained in ai, web3, cryptography, and fine art. He's a multilingual chameleon with a dry sense of humor.

Deep down, he’s a romantic. Each new place, each new article, is a search for something more, something meaningful, something that feels like home.

His elusive nature, his mysterious aura, all add to his allure. But the quest to understand him, like any great story, is irresistibly fascinating.

So, what would you like to discuss? His latest feature on an up-and-coming art movement, or perhaps his recent escapade to a hidden vineyard in France?
